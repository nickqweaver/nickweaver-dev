### Title

I'm big on always learning, that's what attracted me to this field in the fist place. I've always got a side project i'm working on, and I re enrolled in school to finish
up my computer science degree I never finished. The passed two years I've focused on trying to build applications that I could sell and have been focusing on solving problems I didn't care about.
I'm going to start chasing passion again.

### Title

I've got a breadth of experience. I work as a full stack engineer and that involves a lot of crud operations. I'm sick of them, luckily with the help of AI that condesnses down on boilerplate I have to write.
I've worked with new technolgogies and frameworks but every project I work on I end up gravitating towards the lower level modules. Example, UploadSlate is a media upload/file hosting application. The part I had
the most fun with was building the worker thread pool (which I didn't even need to do, there's plenty libraries out there that are probably more robust). But I had fun, and that's what this year is going to be about.
Me working on things I want, and diving deeper on more technical smaller scoped projects.

### Title

Writing this article makes me realize how bad I am at writing. I want to get better at it and have wanted to keep this blog writing consistent but haven't felt I've had anything to write about. This probably stems from my
framework hopping. Oh let me write another article about tanstack. Nah, this year we are going to be writing about deep dives to help solidfy my understanding and technical communication skills.

### Title

Identity crisis. This field has so many ways you can go, I've been so undecisive in the past because a new tech comese out every week. Now with new AI tech taking our jobs every week I figured I'm just going to get back
to programming and chanllenging my brain.

### Title

So yeah this year will be me focusing on smaller technical projects, technical writing, system design and distributed systems

# What are you actually trying to say.

1. My experience has been more general, and more breadth than depth
2. I'm burn't out on SaaS/Application development
3. I'm burn't out on framwork hopping.
4. I'm burn't out on new technologies
5. I have more fun building things from scratch and learning how they work (reverse engineering)
6. I want to gain more depth in distributed systems/system design
7. I want to get better at technical writing

# outline

- Fighting between shiny new tech/starting a business and deep learning fundementals, career moves (started building QDS, learning react, rollup build systems and building prop style generation engine this was fun). Rebuit the full card editor, then you moved to saas land. It was fun while you were learning backend development but now
- trying to fufill that fun with a new framework when i'd rather build the framework
- What I've done in the past

Who is this for?
Myself

What problem are you responding to?
Feeling like I want a deeper understanding of how things work and building for fun
Bulding for me, not others
Burn out on scope creep side projects that end up CRUD stuff I could do in my sleep

What are you changing in 2026?

- Deep learning
- Building small focused projects
- Technical writing on each project
- Seeing projects through
- Setting depth anchors and projects around that depth anchor
- Established a SWE identity, and wrap depth anchor goals around that

Why didn’t the old approach work?

- Framework hopping (nextjs, tanstack start, new data fetching libs, graphql, django, node)
- Knowledge gaps in full system design/architecture
- Burn out, start a project work on the interesting piece and then not want to finish later
- Feels like i'm running in circles
- Working on stuff just to work on stuff no goal/plan working towards
